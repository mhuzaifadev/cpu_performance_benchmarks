## Introduction

The purpose of the CPU Benchmark Software is to enable computer enthusiasts, system administrators, and developers to evaluate and compare the performance of their CPUs. The software utilizes benchmark tests to measure CPU performance accurately and provides an easy-to-use graphical user interface for interaction.

## Features

- Benchmark Selection: Users can choose from a range of benchmark tests to perform accurate performance measurements.
- Multi-Core Utilization: The software leverages multiple CPU cores for parallel execution of benchmark tests to maximize performance.
- Thread Management: Efficient thread management ensures concurrent execution of benchmark tests with thread safety and synchronization.
- Graphical User Interface (GUI): The software provides an intuitive GUI for easy interaction, allowing users to configure settings, view real-time progress, and analyze results.
- Result Capturing: Benchmark results for each test are captured and stored for further analysis.
- Reporting: Detailed reports summarizing the performance of each test are generated.
- Error Handling: Proper error logging and handling mechanisms are implemented for stable and robust operation.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (included in Python standard library)
